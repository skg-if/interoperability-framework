**Research products** may be of four types, as follows.

- **Literature**: Intended for reading by humans (article, thesis, peer-review, blog posts, books, reports, patents, etc.)
- **Research data**: Self-contained, persistently identified digital assets intended for processing (e.g. files containing: tables, metadata collections, dumps; persistent dynamic queries to scientific databases)
- **Research software**: (definition from RDA WG) Research Software includes source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a research purpose. Note that software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc.) that are used for research but were not created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and not Research Software. This differentiation may vary between disciplines. The minimal requirement for achieving computational reproducibility is that all the computational components (Research Software, software used in research, documentation and hardware) used during the research are identified, described, and made accessible to the extent that is possible.
- **Other products**: any digital asset, uniquely identified, whose nature does not fall in the first three types
